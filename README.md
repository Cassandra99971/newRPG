Five nights at freddy's 

Character to choose from, William, Henrey, Micheal, Elizabeth, Crying Child and Charlotte/Charlie. 
they would all have different abilities and strengths and weaknesses that would affect the story in a special way. 
With these characters you would see things or interacts with people or animantronics that other people wouldnt interact with, such as secret characters, mission and even maybe a mystery ending that others cant access.
